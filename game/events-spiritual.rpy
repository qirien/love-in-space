    naomi "But I will share with you one thing, today. When I was a child, my parents both had very different religious beliefs. My mother was a Christian who also practiced many of the traditions of the Acoma Pueblo where she grew up."
    naomi "My father had grown up with Hindu beliefs, and while he wasn't particularly devout, his mother taught me many of the stories and teachings."
    naomi "My parents were always very respectful of each other, and so I grew up thinking there was nothing strange about believing in Jesus and Vishnu and harmony with nature."
    naomi sad "I believed in them with the simple faith of a child.  Until I was fourteen, and my twin sister died at the hands of a violent stranger."
    her surprised "Oh no!"
    naomi sad "It was no longer obvious to me that a loving and caring deity was in charge, or that all souls deserved an afterlife, or that humanity was any good at all. I questioned everything."

    naomi normal "But I decided that if God was really all-powerful, He could help me to understand why He would allow such a thing to happen."
    naomi sad "And so I prayed. I studied. I read scriptures, philosophy, logic, history. I felt like Jacob wrestling with an angel, or like Hanuman chasing the Sun. How was it possible that the death of an innocent girl could be God's plan?"
    her concerned "What did you find?"
    naomi normal "For awhile, nothing but empty platitudes. But one night, I had a dream. My sister was in it, laughing. \"How can you laugh when you died so horribly?\" I asked her."
    naomi "\"That was ages ago!\" she said. \"Death is not the worst thing that can happen.\" And so I asked her, \"What is the worst thing that can happen?\""
    naomi "She just shook her head at me and disappeared."
    naomi sad "Since then, I have thought of many more worse things than death. And I had to ask why God would allow those, too. But, I have come to realize that the purpose of life is not to avoid bad things happening."
    her surprised "What is the purpose of life?"
    naomi normal "To me, the purpose of life is to become your best self. Your self that is the most benevolent, the most knowledgeable: the most divine."
    naomi "But that can only happen when people are allowed to have bad things happen. For it is in the reaction, in the choosing, in the consequences, that we change and become more than we have been."
    naomi "That is why God does not stop all bad things from happening."
    her concerned "But then, what is God?"
    naomi "All my experiences with studying and praying and searching for the divine feed into my concept of \"God.\" God is not something you can understand simply by applying a label like \"Jesus\" or \"Brahman\"."
    naomi normal "God is something you understand through study, prayer, and love. Then, I think, you will see the divine all around you."

    naomi sad "Oh yes. My whole life is built around helping others. But with my stroke, I could barely move, and I needed to be able to accept help instead of giving it."
    her concerned "Why was that so hard?"

    her surprised "You're scared of getting old? No offense, but aren't you already... um, I mean--"

    naomi "Well, that's the problem - if my mental capacity is affected, I might have problems detecting it. And I wonder if those close to me would be honest and tell me if they notice anything?"
